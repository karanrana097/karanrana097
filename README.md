## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm [**Karan Rana**](https://github.com/karanrana097) ([@karanrana097](https://github.com/karanrana097)). I'm an BTech CSE student @ [GEU](https://geu.ac.in/) in my III year, from **India**.

I have knowledge of **Flutter** (+ FFI, Platform channels, BLoC, Provider, Riverpod) & **React.js** (+ React Router). I mainly write **C++, Dart, Python & JavaScript**. 

Few of my popular projects, libraries & apps are pinned below. Other than Flutter & React, I enjoy writing native C++ Windows (Win32, C++/WinRT) & Linux code (as used in my Flutter plugins & other libraries), dealing with audio/video playback, reverse engineering APIs & webscraping. I have good knowledge of object oriented programming, multi-threading & asynchrony as-well.

ðŸ’¬ Mail me at <karanrana1706@gmail.com> or meet me on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/karanrana097) if you wish to hire me.
